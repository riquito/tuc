# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [Unreleased]

- perf: much faster (from 2x up to 3x) implementation:
  * there is now a fast lane used when conditions apply (more or less
    it triggers when you cut fields on 1-byte characters)
  * fields cut is now done on bytes, not strings (as long as your
    delimiter is proper utf-8 you'll be fine)
- feat: display short help when run without arguments
- feat: add the ability to display fallback output when a field is out of bound
  (you can set it per-field using `-f <range>=somefallback` or by providing
  a generic fallback using `--fallback-oob somefallback`)
- feat: it is now possible to type \t while formatting fields and
  output a TAB (as we similary do for \n) e.g. `-f '{1}\t{2}'`
- feat: --characters now depends on the (default) regex feature
- feat: help and short help are colored, as long as output is a tty and
  unless env var TERM=dumb or NO_COLOR (any value) is set
- refactor: --json internally uses serde_json, faster and more precise

## [1.2.0] - 2024-01-01

- feat: new option --json to format output as JSON array
- feat: -r can be used when cutting --characters. It replaces
  the (empty) delimiter between characters with whatever you provided
- feat: exit early when some combinations of fields cannot be used together
- feat: updated dependencies. In particular the regex crate which offers new
  functionalities (word boundary assertions)
- fix: field formatting is now applied to field 1 even if no delimiters
  are found (similar to how we print the unformatted field 1)
- doc: many error messages have been rewritten for better clarity
- doc: new svg demo in the README

## [1.1.0] - 2023-12-02

- feat: no more need to pass --join when using --replace, it's implied
- feat: new error messages when applying some incompatible options
